# TeamCity Log Parcer

## Purpose

We need a tool to parce teamcity logs and put it in in-memory tree data structure. So we can visualize it as a _flame graph_ using for instance https://github.com/spiermar/d3-flame-graph

## Deps

* Node 7
* Babel
* ESLint
* Nodemon
* Yarn (optional)

## Usage
- `yarn install` to install deps
- `yarn start` to run it
- `yarn run dev` to run auto-reloading nodemon server
- `yarn run eslint` to run code-analysis
